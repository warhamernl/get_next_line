# get_next_line

This was my 3rd project on Codam.

This project was about printing line by line from a text file.

This was a solo project. gnl1 is the version which got turned in which uses an array.

gnl2 was a project together with kimthulhu to deepen ourselves about the concept about linked list.

This wasnt turned in but we did learned a lot about linked list.

git clone the project.

In each folder there is a makefile to compile the executable.

to compile type in make in the directory where the makefile is in the terminal.

then compile the exectuable with the test files which are a directory above.
